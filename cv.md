## About me
I graduated from an economics college. My education is not related to  programming, but my last job opened up the digital world. 

My last job was as a HR manager. Including I talked a lot with developers who wanted to get into our team. Before each interview, our team leader told me about candidates' tests and the technical part of the project they were working on.

This is where my interest in development began.
